These issues contribute to a suboptimal user experience, diminished trust in service reliability, and environmental friendliness concerns.
To address these challenges, a modern car hire system utilizing a JSON Server and a user-friendly website aims to streamline the booking process, eradicate overbooking and inventory inaccuracies, and promote eco-friendly vehicle options.
This solution seeks to change the car rental industry by providing a more efficient, reliable, and environmentally friendly platform for users.
